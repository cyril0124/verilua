# Verilua

`Verilua` is a versatile simulation framework for Hardware Verification based on `LuaJIT`. It can be used as a Hardwave Verification Language (`HVL`) to write testbenches and simulate hardware designs. Or it can be used as a Hardware Script Engine (`HSE`) to embed Lua scripts into the simulation. It can also can be used as a Waveform Analysis Language(`WAL`) to analyze the provided waveform files(VCD, FST, FSDB, etc).
